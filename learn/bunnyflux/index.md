# Bunny Flux

I once had a physics professor explain the term *flux* by drawing a field with
bunnies in it, and then described the flux as number of bunnies entering and
leaving the field. I was struck by the silliness of the term *Bunny Flux*, and
now I want to actually compute the *Bunny Flux*.

To compute the Bunny Flux, I will use Modern Fortran, the Fortran Package
Manager, and the fortran-stdlib project. This is an intermediate level tutorial.
I will assume you are familiar with the basics -- variables, types, loops,
conditionals, etc. There are other excellent minibooks that go over those things.

Let's get started!
